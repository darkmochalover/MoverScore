_DESCRIPTION = """\
Embedding-based metric is an alternative to using word-overlap based metrics is to consider the meaning of each word as defined by a word embedding, which assigns a vector to each word.
Methods such as Word2Vec calculate these embeddings using distributional semantics; that is, they approximate the meaning of a word by considering how often it co-occurs with other words in the corpus.4 These embeddingbased metrics usually approximate sentence-level embeddings using some heuristic to combine the vectors of the individual words in the sentence.
The sentence-level embeddings between the candidate and target response are compared using a measure such as cosine distance.
